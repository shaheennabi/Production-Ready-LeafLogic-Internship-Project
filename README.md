# Problem Statement

**Note:** This project simulates an industry-standard scenario where we, a team of three contributors at XYZ Company, are developing an intelligent system capable of recognizing various plants and crops while providing users with accurate and detailed information about them. This system is designed to prevent misinformation and overpricing in the market by ensuring users can verify plant details instantly.

## High-Level Note
Concepts related to AI agents, their pipelines, methodologies, and automated research processes have already been discussed. You can find these details in the *docs* folder for further exploration.

## ðŸŒ± Building an Automated Plant and Crop Recognition System ðŸŒ¿

At XYZ Company, we were tasked with developing a powerful AI-driven system that could recognize up to 100 different types of plants and crops while fetching complete details about them from the internet. The goal was to enable users to identify plants and obtain reliable information effortlessly, reducing the chances of misleading sales practices in the plant market.

### To achieve this, we leveraged a combination of:

- **Object Detection Models**: To accurately recognize various plant and crop species.
- **Multi-AI Agent Pipeline**: Handling detailed research on the detected plant/crop, covering scientific details, historical significance, health benefits, seasonal information, market price, and more.
- **OpenAI Model & UI Integration**: Generates a summary that is sent to the user via email.

## ðŸŒ¿ Our Role as Developers ðŸŒ±

As a team of three contributors, our mission is to build a high-quality, scalable system that:

- Accurately detects a wide range of plants and crops.
- Automates the research process using multi-AI agents to gather real and accurate information from the internet.
- Ensures modular architecture for future scalability and easy maintenance.
- Provides users with trustworthy, well-structured insights on each recognized plant/crop.
- Maintains cost efficiency while delivering high performance and reliability.

This system is designed to deliver seamless plant identification and detailed research findings, ensuring that users have access to verified and comprehensive information. By integrating advanced Object Detection and AI Agents, we aim to create a reliable solution that empowers users with knowledge and prevents misinformation in the market.
